Prodigy Data Science Task 03 üìù
Description
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Utilize a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Perform data preprocessing, train the classifier, evaluate its performance, and visualize the decision tree.

Introduction
This project utilizes the Bank Marketing dataset, which contains information about customers and their interactions with marketing campaigns. The goal is to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on various demographic and behavioral attributes. The project starts by loading the dataset and conducting data preprocessing tasks such as encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Then, it trains a decision tree classifier, evaluates its performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, and visualizes the decision tree for better understanding.

Usage
Ensure Python and required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) are installed.
Download the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Run the script to execute data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
